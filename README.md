This is a notebook that users can use to grow a tree in a graph interactively. It is tailored for finding the shortest path between two points, but the interactive widget could be easily implemented for learning about any tree growing algorithm. Just run the code, then select edges from the frontiers in the dropdown to watch the graph change to reflect the path taken.
